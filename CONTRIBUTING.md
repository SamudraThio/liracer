# Contributing
Thanks for taking the time to contribute.

## Snippets
The easiest way to contribute is to submit a code snippet. The snippets are stored in [snippets/<language>](snippets/). They need to fullfil the following requirements. **Please ensure that these requirements are met before submitting a pull request. I receive a lot of PRs and may simply close non-conforming PRs with no comment.**
- Use literal tabs(not spaces) for indention.
- Have maximum 79 characters per line.
- Have no trailing newline.
- Be idiomatic and well written.
- Be moderately short.
- Be *interesting*. The code should either display the syntax of a language with a familiar, easily digestible example such as [fibonacci.cpp](https://github.com/olav35/liracer-rewrite/blob/master/snippets/c%2B%2B/fibonacci.cpp), [hello_world.hs](https://github.com/olav35/liracer-rewrite/blob/master/snippets/haskell/hello_world.hs) or [fibonacci_sequence.rb](https://github.com/olav35/liracer-rewrite/blob/master/snippets/ruby/fibonacci_sequence.rb), or be a real-life example.
- Be valid code. The code does not need to be self sufficient, but no syntax errors should be present.
- Be legitimate contributions(not spam garbage).
- Follow the language conventions listed below if your language has a section. Otherwise feel free to add your own. If language conventions conflict with the universal requirements, the universal requirements are prioritized.

For a start you can translate an already existing quote to a new language.

### Languages
#### C/C++
- Use snake_case for files, functions and variables.
- Use SCREAM_CASE for symbolic constants.
- Have function prototypes at the top, main function in the middle and other functions thereafter.
#### Haskell
- Use camelCase for files and functions.
- Use PascalCase for types.
#### Java
- Use PascalCase for files, classes and interfaces.
- Use camelCase for methods.
- Use SCREAM_CASE for constants.
#### JavaScript
- Use snake_case for files, functions and variables.
- Only use let and const (no var).
- Do not use trailing semicolons.
#### Python
- Use snake_case for files, functions and variable.
#### Ruby
- Use snake_case for files, methods and variables.

## Other
There are of course other ways to contribute too. If you run into an issue or have an idea for the project feel free to submit them in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/olav35/liracer-rewrite/issues). You can also try implementing the feature requests or fixing the issues there. Make sure to say that you are working on it, to prevent multiple people doing the same work.
